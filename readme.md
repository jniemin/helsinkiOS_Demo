# Demo application for HelsinkiOS May 2015 meetup

This is the React Native demo application presented in HelsinkiOS May 2015 meetup.

You can use it freely how every you want, but no support is provided.

To get demo running, follow getting started instructions from React Native website https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

Application uses imgur.com as source of its images. To be able to load the content for the application, you need API keys from imgur.com. You can follow the instructions https://api.imgur.com to get the API keys. Once you have the keys just replace apiKey with your Client ID part of the key

```
// image_scroll_view.js
var apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
```


After this you should be all ready to go.
